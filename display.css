/* 
position - property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).
There are five different position values:
static
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky

position: static;
HTML elements are positioned static by default.

position: relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

position: absolute;
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor 
(instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
